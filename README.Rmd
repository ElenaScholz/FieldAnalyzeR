## The goal of PACKAGENAME is ...

The primary objective of the provided package is to:

-   Simplify the preprocessing steps for in-situ temperature data time series selection.

-   Enable users to focus on data analysis.

-   Facilitate access to AppEEARS data within R, particularly referencing datasets derived from remote sensing applications.

    <!-- -->

## Installation

You can install the development version of PACKAGENAME like so:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("ElenaScholz/PACKAGENAME")
```

## Workflow

1.  Data Analysis of field Temperature Data

    1.  Read in data and reorganize it into a list of data frames

    2.  Improve the column readability by renaming them

    3.  Enhance data structure by mutating the date/time column

    4.  Aggregate data frames by Year, Month, Day or Season

2.  Exploration of the Datasets

    1.  Create simple plots to gain an overview of the logger data.

    2.  Utilize the 'show_appeears_products' function to explore all available AppEEARS products.

3.  Retrive Reference Data

    1.  Authenticate with AppEEARS using 'appeears_login' to obtain a token

    2.  Submit tasks to download reference data and filter all products by the topics for your analysis

4.  Data Download and Processing

    1.  After the task submission is done you'll receive an Email and you can start the data download

5.  Integration and Visualization

    1.  Apply similar pre-processing steps (1.1 -1.4) to the downloaded reference datasets

    2.  Plot logger data and reference datasets together

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(loggeranalysis)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
